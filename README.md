<h1> Inspiration </h1>
<p> As a passionante NFL fan, I find myself asking the same qustion every year. Which NFL running back is the best rusher? When determining ths, we are given fairly limited information (Yards, YPC, and Carries). Other factors people use to assess a running backs abillity would be their style of play. To answer this question, I am utilizing my knowldge of Python and Pandas to answer this question. Disclaimer - this anaysis does not factor the quality of blocking, or strength of schedule.</p>
